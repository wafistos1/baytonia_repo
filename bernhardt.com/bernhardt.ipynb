Its clean façade shows off the Whisper of Gold custom round ribbed pulls and thin crisscrossed stretchers between the tall square-tapered legs. Six drawers, painted on the inside in Seal Skin, are generous in size. The top of the piece is embedded with dark glass. The top right drawer has dividers and a taupe/charcoal herringbone pad. The front of the left drawer drops down. At the bottom of the piece are two hidden drawers for papers and valuables. This is a signature dresser with dignified style.\n",

      "Description: That’s Italian for ‘good night’, and it’s our name for this sweet closed storage piece, designed with the bedroom in mind. There’s one drawer, and a pair of doors to hide away your night-time reading. The natural patterns in highly figured Tiger Maple veneer - used on the drawer fronts and case sides - are allowed to shine through our soft, Smoke grey finish. For the frame, we used a Taupe Silver Leaf application that we think results in a stunning combination. We added our favorite creme stone top, too, the perfect landing for your cup of morning java, and sparkly, jewelry-like hardware for the drawers. Next to your bed, Buona Notte is a beautiful way to start or end your day. Marry up Buona Notte with Italian Dressing, if you cannot get enough of this beautiful finish.\n",

The layered door pulls, with highly intricate scrolls and floral patterns, are a piece of art unto themselves. Framing the credenza on each side are translucent acrylic posts that feature a small floral motif. We particularly like how they resemble champagne bubbles. A black stone top completes the story and is a perfect surface for serving beverages or hot dishes. Customized pull out trays, behind the left and right doors, are carved to accommodate your favorite wine bottles. A final Signature detail is the locking drawer behind the center door. This stunning piece is completed with conical legs with polished Majestic Gold details. Drama meets design in the dining room with this piece.\n",

Classic dark leather strapping around the seat deck provides the base upon which a plush dark espresso chenille cushion sits. Suspended from its metal frame is the winged outer back of the chair in fumed figured eucalyptus wood, finished to a high sheen in Aged Bourbon. A matching back cushion in the same espresso chenille completes this look that is at once retro and remade.\n",

It promises a smooth and relaxing transition from living to dining and again in reverse. It’s a lovely way to entertain and speaks to designer José Leite de Castro’s insightful understanding of what it means to fully embrace the role of host or hostess. Upholstered in an animal-inspired neutral embroidered fabric rendered in a shimmery golden-taupe hue, it’s perched atop Mid-century Modern angular wood legs. The chair’s flirty silhouette is further emphasized by a winter-white linen welt that outlines its curves. A smart little pillow created from the same fashionable print provides lumbar support.\n",

Such is the case with the Divergent Chest, a narrow piece designed for the essential, yet hard to find, mid-range height. Its thoughtful dimensions encourage the eye to travel around the room and explore instead of resting only on the tallest and shortest pieces. This Ebony Macassar Cabinet is intricately inlayed with French Brass in an enchanting pattern that wraps around the cabinet like a true work of art. Open its doors to see how the hinges are integrated into the brass inlay design. Perched atop an airy open-leg base and finished in Black lacquer, this is a statement piece that will elevate the style of any room. The designer recommends using this smart cabinet in pairs to add symmetry to a space.\n",

      "Description: Looking for a distinctive cocktail table to add a warm yet modern focal point? Look no further, the Flow Cocktail table’s curvy, oblong shape and modern mix of materials promises to create a striking centerpiece while adding interesting layers of texture. We particularly love the contrast between the softness of the Urban Brass, the linear woodgrain of the Ebony Macassar and the sleekness of Urban Black lacquer. Urban brass forms the table’s base and creates a layer of interest between the wood veneer and black lacquer. The table’s surface is rendered in a reflective bronze glass that is artfully rimmed in Urban Brass—creating a rich, lustrous look. For an interesting juxtaposition of shapes, consider pairing the oblong-shaped Flow Cocktail table with the circular-shaped Anonymous Cocktail table.\n",

Offsetting the hard surfaces of the piece are side insets and three drawers finished in neutral faux shagreen. Drawer interiors shimmer in Taupe Paint. Open the center drawer to find a pencil holder and easy storage of slim materials. Each side drawer offers an additional work surface with hidden storage underneath. Each drawer is outfitted with custom metal and Mother of Pearl hardware. Sitting down to work was never this beautiful.\n",

Contrasting accent pillows add additional style, fashioned in a deep gunmetal grey velvet and a contemporary styled black and white herringbone stitch. A cut-out boxing design around the outside back and a recessed wood plinth base in Simply Black complete this piece distinctive aesthetic style.\n",

Its sumptuous seating area is bordered by a one-of-a-kind wood frame featuring carvings inspired by the patterns of a palace balcony railing in India. The layering of metal fretwork behind the wood was inspired by the dual shadow cast on the balcony by the setting sun as seen through the railing’s design. Creating a high fashion look unique to itself, these elements are highlighted with illuminating shades of Soft Silver Paint and Champagne Gold.
